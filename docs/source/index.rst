Open Contracts Documentation
===========================

Overview
------------

Open Contracts consist of smart contracts on Ethereum, and off-chain logic bundled in a git repo. For now, only GitHub is supported but we may integrate with IPFS in the future.
If you set up your repo correctly, you will automatically create a Web3 page at https://dapp.opencontracts.io/#/github-user/repo-name where users can interact with your contract.

In these docs, you will learn:
