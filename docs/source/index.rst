Open Contracts Documentation
===========================

Overview
------------

Open Contracts consist of smart contracts on Ethereum, and off-chain logic bundled in a git repo, which must be hosted on GitHub for now.

If you set up your repo correctly, you will automatically create a Web3 page where users can interact with your contract, hosted at:
https://dapp.opencontracts.io/#/github-user/repo-name 
Anyone can fork your repo to host your contract under their own github username as well. Anyone can fork our website and host it under their own domain as well.

Fortunately, the docs are short and simple:
